  ‘Campus Clubs’ is a management system for the activities of student clubs on campus. The website allows a student to keep track of the various activities and events undertaken by different student bodies. Student heads of these bodies can post announcements for events, notices, recordings of previous events, general info articles, etc to be viewed by the students.  By choosing to follow a club all information and announcements of the student campus life are at the students’ fingertips.
